This code assumes that there is a 'templates' directory in the same directory as this script, and that directory contains a 'schedule.html' file. The 'schedule.html' file is a Jinja2 template that will be filled with the data from the other modules. The resulting HTML file will be saved as 'schedule.html' in the same directory as this script.
